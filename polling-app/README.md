## First Draft
<span>___________</span>
<br></br>
The initial draft of the project was based on the idea that the app would be a web app, not a desktop app. The app was to run locally on your browser.

I utilized HTML and CSS to create the frontend, and began work with ajax tools and PHP to build basic scripts for the database logic. At this point, I hadn't even put any thought into how I was going to set up the database, hosting, etc. This became a challenge for a few days.

After reconsidering the first draft's setup, I began experimenting.

<br></br>

## Draft 1.5
<span>___________</span>
<br></br>
The "draft" in-between the first and second draft was shortlived. In this stage, I began experimenting with React.js and Azure SQL Servers/Databases. 

I realized that this approach would be time and resource inefficient, and that I'd need to scale back the project into something more lightweight so that I could stay organized and on-time.

Finally, I decided upon a second draft...

<br></br>

## Second Draft
<span>___________</span>
<br></br>
The second draft was only a minor adaptation of the first draft. This version was intended to be run as a windowed application using Flask and an SQLite database, maintaining the CSS and HTML for the frontend, and rewriting the backend logic in Python.

I began work on this version, but realized that the number of files became overwhelming. Between HTML, stylesheets, dependencies, and scripts, my hands were bound. I've created windowed Flask apps before, but I suspected that the type of app I was envisioning would work better with another library or framework.

I did some research on Google, and I found some results suggesting PyQt for a project similar to mine. I quickly learned how to use PyQt and Qt Editor, and moved on to the third and final draft...

<br></br>

## Third and Final Draft
<span>___________</span>

The final draft is what you see today. I removed the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and all of my Flask app Python files. I installed PyQt6 to my virtual machine, but realized I'd have to downgrade my Python version to escape an issue with the interpreter. 

Next:

1. I installed pyqt_tools
2. I ran `designer.exe` from pyqt_tools
3. I created the .ui file for my app

At this point in the project, I had not actually done anything with the sqlite database. So, I got to work. I decided to write a Python module that would simplify **POST** and **GET** requests to the database. This is called `appdb.py` in the *'python'* folder. 

(I will cover the design and development of the database further along in the *README*)

I then filled the database with random data using an SQL script called `init.sql` in the *'sqlite/queries'* path. You can find most of the data currently in the database in some of the **INSERT INTO** statements.

Initially, I filled the *'sqlite/queries'* path with many SQL queries to be read by my app. I eventually opted to create one, large .sql file with all of the queries, and read the content line by line. You can find this logic in the `query_strings.py` module.

**Note:** Be cautious handling the `main.db` file. These files are sensitive and susceptible to data corruption. If this occurs, you may create a new instance from the repository, or copy and paste a new instance of the existing, corrupted database (within the same path *with the same name* if you're seeking app functionality.)

<br></br>

## In-Depth Look at PyQt Logic
<span>___________</span>

This project is fully dependent on PyQt6. The `.ui` file generated from Qt Designer can be found in the *'python'* folder. The app has a total of 8 unique pages, each being an index under a QStackedWidget. I've mapped button 'clicked' triggers with index-changing slots in the `pyqt6app.py` file. 

The slots utilize class methods from `appdb.py` to create an object (instance) of a class (table.) Then, `appdb.py` utilizes `connections.py` to access the database file and process queries. Utilizing an object-oriented style in a project like this allows for much more organized, readable code. Creating object attributes mirrors the structure of the database tables and their respective columns.

My Qt forms are created using **QTextEdit** and **QPushButton** widgets, with the **QPushButton** triggering either a **POST** or **GET** database request. For example, the **QTextEdit** widget's text will be gathered with the *'.text()'* method. Then, the input will be inserted into placeholder spots in the unique query's script body. The **QPushButton** will trigger a connected slot, which will execute a **POST** request with the interpolated query. 

**Note:** Only the username and password inputs are sniffed for injection strings (currently.)

Many of the pages have initialization steps or in-place actions that dynamically shift the content of the page. These shifts are performed with **GET** requests and logic. The *'.setText()'*, *'.move()'*, and *'.resize()'* methods are the most common **QtWidgets** methods that you'll see me use in this context.

***Worth Mentioning:*** The logic for hashing and dehashing passwords is dependent on bcrypt. Make sure you have this dependency installed for the downloaded version of this app.

## Developing and Designing a Database
<span>___________</span>

I loosely followed the DBLC while developing this project. First, I collected the basic rules/constraints: data must be persistent and similar to IGN's in-text polls. Then, with those in mind, I created a basic ERD:

![Preliminary ERD](./misc/ERD.jpg)

This model was comprehensive, simple, and effective. Happy with the diagram, I advanced to DBMS selection. As I mentioned previously, I was initially going to use Azure SQL services for my database and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio as a DBMS.

Due to the nature of this project, I went with an SQLite database as the data storage method. The structure and scalability work well for a project like this. I'm experienced with relational databases and SQL databases, so I didn't spend time confusing myself by looking for any other options. In my mind, flat files would not be appropriate for the app, either. This eliminated the necessity for PHP files and a server.

Implementing the database was very straightforward, and took only around 20 minutes to set up with example data. I also used the SQLite viewer extension on Visual Studio Code to view the data, for debugging and management purposes.

<br></br>

## Database App Integration
<span>___________</span>

The sqlite3 library is included in the Python standard library (most versions.) This library makes Python + SQLite integration quick and easy. 

I decided to structure this project modularly, as the main `pyqt6_app.py` is long enough as is. Modular programming worked well for the app.

So, this project can be broken down into this modular hierarchy:

1. `app.ui` <- front-end
2. `pyqt6_app.py` <- front-end wrapper + scripting
3. `appdb.py` <- query/requests logic
4. `connections.py` <- python to .* interface
5. `main.db` <- sqlite database
6. `queries.sql` <- list of sql queries to execute

With these short descriptions, we can now determine the flow of data. First, '*pyqt6_app.py*' grabs the path to `main.db` and `app.ui` and stores them in a global variable. A '*Connection()*' instance is created to represent the database. A '*Gui()*' instance is created, which inherits from '*QMainWindow()*.' Thus, the '*Gui()*' instance displays the contents of our '*QMainWindow*' widget.

We create a '*sqlite3.Cursor()*' instance upon calling the '*.cursor()*' method for a connection. The cursor is used to perform CRUD operations, and it has extremely useful methods such as '*.execute()*', '*.executescript()*', '*.fetchone()*', and '*.fetchall().*' Before utilizing the cursor, we must use the '*get_query_strings*' function in '*query_strings.py*' to fetch the appropriate query to execute.

I've wrapped '*.execute()*' and '*.fetchall()*' in the '*query_get*' function of `appdb.py`, and '*.executescript()*' in the '*query_post*' function. These functions will interpolate the query with user input and utilize the appropriate cursor methods to alter the database.

The bulk of the code is in attributes (QWidgets) and '*query_get*'/'*query_post*' functions, so this section should help with any comprehension issues in reading the code.
