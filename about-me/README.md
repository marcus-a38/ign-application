# Let's Talk About You

I've known about IGN for at least 10 years. As a kid, my friends would occassionally show me IGN articles or reviews on Nintendo games we liked. I have an incredibly vivid memory of one particular day-- a day when my friend and I had been playing Pokemon on my Nintendo DS all day long. When we finally took a break, we discovered the infamous "too much water" review (and all the memes that came with it.) I fondly recall how funny we thought it was. IGN floated around my life for many years, as someone who used to play videogames regularly.

IGN only seems like it's gotten bigger and better over the years. I've told my friends and family that this is my favorite application I've ever submitted. I love your approach to screening candidates. The process is fair, fun, and interactive. Even better than that: this is by far the largest and most complete project I've ever developed.

I'm proud of myself for producing a quality project in about a week and a half. The motivation of the task/time-frame and the pride of developing a quality project has been awesome, as I thrive under pressure. After learning more about IGN and completing this application, I feel that it would be an immense privelege to intern at the company. I'm confident that my talents and passion would flourish at IGN, and an internship would be astronomically beneficial for both the company and myself.
